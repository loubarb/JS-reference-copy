    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let age = 100;
      // let age2 = age;
      // console.log(age, age2); // result is 100, 100
      // age = 200;
      // console.log(age, age2); // result is 200, 100 because value of age goes into variable at the same time

      // let name = 'Lou';
      // let name2 = name;
      // console.log(name, name2);
      // name = 'Louis';
      // console.log(name, name2);
    // if you change/reassign the original variable, it will not update the other variable



    // Let's say we have an array and we want to make a copy of it.
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
      const team = players;  
      console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array? - makes a reference, not a copy
      // updating team is NOT the array - team is a REFERENCE to original array
      // when you try to update the array, it will go back to the original reference where it was
      // this is NOT the same as with numbers, strings, booleans

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice(); // returns entire array when slice is passed nothing
      team2[3] = 'Lux';
      console.log(team2); // includes the updated array value
      console.log(players); // makes copy of original array
      // therefore, using splice() will make a copy; then you can update array while still keeping the original one as is

    // or create a new array ( [] ) and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      // takes every item out of iterable and into the containing array in this case
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = 'Billy';
      console.log(team4);
      console.log(players); // still keeps original array untouched

    // or use array.from
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[3] = 'Marilyn';
      console.log(team5); // updated
      console.log(players); // untouched

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
